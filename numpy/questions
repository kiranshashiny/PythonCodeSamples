4 marks questions :

soilmoisture/dry           75 
soilmoisture/wet        50
soilmoisture/submerged  0

2. Write a program  that connects to a client, disconnects and then connects back. Validate that the connections are still connected back to the broker.

3. Write call backs to check the acknowledgement messages for qos set to 0, 1 and 2.

4. Write a program that will stay in subscribe mode and will listen to any messages of topic weatherdat/<all>


8 marks questions :

1. Connect to a MQTT Broker, ( like Cloudmqtt.com ) and set up the credentials by going thru their web site and 
write a program to publish a "temperature/room" 28


2. Repeat the same above, but repeat sending the temperature/room every 1 minute apart.

3. Same program above, but integrate the subscribe() into it, and listen to all messages.
Watch the cloudmqtt console to see that the messages have arrived at the console from the client.

4. Write 2 clients that connects to a broker over the same port, and user name/pwd etc and one of it is sending temperature/# while the other is sending soilmoisturecontent/#
