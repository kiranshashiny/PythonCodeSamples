plt.show() - to show the lines - that was created earlier.

If plt.x and y were not created - then there is nothing to show ()

x and y have to be same number of elements.

plot ( x, y, ":" ) - will add a colin as the lines.
plot ( x, y, "-" ) - will add a colin as the lines.
plot ( x, y, "o" ) - will add a  circle marker
plot ( x, y, "v" ) - will add a  triangle
plot ( x, y, "ob" ) - will add a  circle marker in blue
	ob = 'o= circle marker, b = blue
	or = 'o= circle marker, r = red
	b  for blue

	g green, 
	c cyan
 	y yellow
	m magenta	
	:wq



To plot bar chars, use the plt.bar () function.

x = [ 1,2,3,4 ]
y = [7,8,9,0]

plt.bar ( x, y ) 
plt.bar ( x, y )  - NOT plt.plot !!!!!!
